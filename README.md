## Edit (6/12/2020) - Decided to improve on this app for my final project for my Software Design Class (csc 22100)
#### Added the following new features
      1. Next button: When the user clicks this button, the user will be able to access the next card in the deck. 
      2. Error message pop up: This will pop up if the user forgets to write anything in the question or the answer section and clicks            on the down arrow button. 
      3. Delete button: This will allow the user to delete an existing card from the deck.
